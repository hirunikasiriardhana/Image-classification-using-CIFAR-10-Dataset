# Image-classification-using-CIFAR-10-Dataset
This project involves training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, such as airplanes, cars, birds, and cats. The input to the model is the pixel values ​​of these images, normalized to be between 0 and 1. The output is a probability distribution over the 10 classes for each image, generated by the softmax activation function in the final layer. The model's performance is evaluated by comparing these predictions to the true labels, and accuracy is visualized through training and validation accuracy/loss plots.
